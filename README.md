# A songs app that lists songs 


The data is stored in room, I am still learning room so my implementation can probably be improved!

//todo 
- add architecture choice (MVVM) and why
- add library choices and why

to add -
code style for better readability
cache strategy
a fake tracker impl
tests
tests room https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/testing-db
leak canary only in debug
the domain layer may not be useful in this app, in a real app, we could do some operation there like aggregating data from various repo, transforming it etc


// nice to have
- elaborated Dark mode
